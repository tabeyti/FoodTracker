GENERAL
- User profiles ****
	* Need to pull username and passwords from server using RPC
	* Need to have it save xml's in a folder based on the a user profile (log entries, food list, goals, etc.)
		- there will be shared data?

DAY ENTRY

FOOD LIST
- Move up bottom bar and/or make it look pretty 
	- remove fixed bottom bar maybe
- Need to have hashed lookup of food instead of sequential string search.

EXTRA
- Workout tracker
- Caffeine and Sodium measurements
	
GRAPH
- Add a range selection feature on any range entered in for dates (range end doesn't have to be today's date)
- Need scrolling support
- Add selection of multiple foods to see in tandum (maybe)
	- Maybe add category for each food (fruits, vegitables, meats, etc.).




LEFT OFF AT
- Unit is not saved with food entry, having to pull from food list (which should be done regardless?)

ISSUES
- Day Entry graph doesn't show up if the monitor size is too small yet Foodlistpanel doesn't have an issue.
- When selecting day using the dateBox in DayBar...an exception occurs.



*** OVERALL ***
- May restructure application to be a generic tracker that tracks multiple things beyond just nutrition.
	- Mood
	- Medication
	- Sleep
